      "question": "What is Bitcoin?",
      "answer": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates without a central authority or banks. It enables peer-to-peer transactions on a global scale through a network of computers running the Bitcoin protocol. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.",

      "question": "How does a Bitcoin transaction work from start to finish?",
      "answer": "A Bitcoin transaction follows several steps:\n1. The sender initiates a transaction using their wallet, specifying the recipient's Bitcoin address and amount\n2. The wallet creates a transaction message, including inputs (previous transactions) and outputs (new recipients)\n3. The transaction is signed with the sender's private key\n4. The signed transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network\n5. Mining nodes verify the transaction by checking:\n   - Input transactions exist and are unspent\n   - Sender has sufficient balance\n   - Digital signatures are valid\n6. Verified transaction enters the mempool (memory pool)\n7. Miners include the transaction in a block\n8. Once the block is mined and added to the blockchain, the transaction is confirmed\n9. Additional blocks built on top provide more confirmation security\nThe entire process typically takes 10-60 minutes depending on network conditions and fee levels.",

      "question": "Explain the relationship between private keys, public keys, and Bitcoin addresses.",
      "answer": "The relationship follows a one-way cryptographic hierarchy:\n1. Private Key: A randomly generated 256-bit number that serves as the root of ownership. Must be kept secret.\n2. Public Key: Generated from the private key using elliptic curve multiplication (secp256k1). This operation cannot be reversed.\n3. Bitcoin Address: Created from the public key through:\n   - SHA-256 hashing of the public key\n   - RIPEMD160 hashing of the result\n   - Adding version byte\n   - Creating checksum\n   - Base58Check encoding\nThis creates a system where:\n- Private key → can generate public key and sign transactions\n- Public key → can verify signatures and generate address\n- Address → can only receive funds\nThe one-way nature of these cryptographic functions ensures security of funds even if the address and public key are widely shared.",

      "answer": "Base58Check encoding is a modified base58 encoding system used in Bitcoin to convert addresses into a user-friendly format. It serves multiple purposes:\n1. Error Detection: Includes a checksum to catch typing/copying errors\n2. Readability: Eliminates similar-looking characters (0, O, I, l)\n3. Efficiency: More compact than hex representation\nThe encoding process:\n1. Takes the RIPEMD160 hash output\n2. Adds version byte prefix\n3. Creates double-SHA256 checksum\n4. Appends first 4 checksum bytes\n5. Converts to base58 string\nThis results in addresses starting with '1' for regular addresses or '3' for script addresses, making them easily recognizable and resistant to transcription errors.",

They are generated through a trial-and-error process:\n1. Generate random private key\n2. Derive public key\n3. Create Bitcoin address\n4. Check if it matches desired pattern\n5. If no match, repeat from step 1\nThe difficulty increases exponentially with the length of the desired pattern. Each character adds a factor of 58 more attempts needed. While vanity addresses are cosmetic, they must still maintain all cryptographic properties of regular addresses.",

Network Congestion:\n   - Current mempool size\n   - Number of pending transactions\n3. Priority Desired:\n   - Higher fees = faster confirmation\n   - Lower fees = longer wait times\nFees are typically calculated as satoshis per byte (sat/byte). Miners prioritize transactions with higher fee rates when building blocks. During high congestion, fees increase as users compete for block space.

      "question": "What is blockchain decentralization?",
      "answer": "Blockchain decentralization refers to the distribution of power, control, and decision-making across a network of participants rather than having a single central authority. In a decentralized blockchain system, transactions and data are verified and recorded by multiple nodes in the network, ensuring transparency, security, and resistance to manipulation. This eliminates the need for intermediaries and creates a trustless environment where participants can interact directly with each other.",

These self-executing contracts contain predefined rules and conditions written in code that automatically execute when specific conditions are met. They operate on blockchain networks, ensuring transparency, immutability, and trustless execution. Smart contracts eliminate the need for traditional third-party enforcement mechanisms, reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and enabling truly peer-to-peer transactions and complex automated processes.",

      "question": "What are Application-Specific Blockchains (ASBCs) and how do they differ from general-purpose blockchains?",
      "answer": "Application-Specific Blockchains (ASBCs) are customized blockchain networks designed and optimized for particular use cases or applications, rather than serving as general-purpose platforms. Unlike general blockchains like Ethereum that support a wide range of applications, ASBCs are built with specialized features, consensus mechanisms, and architectural components that cater to specific industry requirements. For example, supply chain ASBCs might prioritize traceability and verification features, while healthcare ASBCs would emphasize privacy and data access controls. This specialization typically results in better performance, lower costs, and more efficient resource utilization for the targeted use case. ASBCs often sacrifice flexibility for optimization in their specific domain, creating purpose-built solutions rather than one-size-fits-all approaches.",

The primary issues include throughput limitations, where networks like Bitcoin can only process 7-10 transactions per second compared to Visa's 24,000+. Latency is another concern, as confirmation times increase with network congestion, reducing user experience quality. Energy consumption remains problematic, especially for Proof of Work systems that require massive computational resources. Additionally, as networks grow, the centralization risk increases when mining or validation becomes concentrated among fewer participants with greater resources. These scaling challenges have spurred research into alternative consensus mechanisms like Delegated Proof of Stake, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance variants, and directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures that promise better performance while maintaining decentralization and security.",

      "question": "What is sharding in blockchain technology and how does it address scalability issues?",
      "answer": "Sharding is a database partitioning technique adapted for blockchain networks that horizontally splits the blockchain's state into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard contains its own independent state and transaction history, and a specific subset of nodes processes transactions only for their assigned shards. This parallel processing architecture allows the network to process multiple transactions simultaneously across different shards, dramatically increasing throughput capacity. Ethereum 2.0's implementation aims to create 64 separate shard chains that operate concurrently while maintaining security through a coordination mechanism via the Beacon Chain. The key challenge in blockchain sharding is maintaining security and decentralization while preventing cross-shard attacks, which is typically addressed through random validator assignment and cross-shard communication protocols. By enabling parallel transaction processing, sharding can potentially increase blockchain throughput by orders of magnitude without sacrificing the network's fundamental security properties.",

      "answer": "Layer 2 solutions are scaling frameworks built on top of existing blockchains (Layer 1) that handle transactions off the main chain while inheriting the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain. Unlike on-chain scaling approaches that modify the base protocol itself (like increasing block size or implementing sharding), Layer 2 solutions process transactions externally before anchoring them to the main chain. Key Layer 2 technologies include state channels (like Lightning Network), which enable private payment channels between parties; Plasma frameworks, which create child chains with their own consensus mechanisms; Rollups (both Optimistic and ZK), which execute transactions off-chain but post transaction data or validity proofs on-chain; and Sidechains, which operate as separate blockchains with two-way pegs to the main chain. The primary advantage of Layer 2 solutions is their ability to achieve high throughput and lower fees without modifying the base layer's consensus rules or sacrificing security. This approach allows the main chain to remain decentralized and secure while scaling transaction capacity through complementary systems.",

      "answer": "Code obfuscation in blockchain applications is the process of deliberately making smart contract source code difficult to understand, reverse engineer, or analyze while preserving its functionality. This technique transforms readable code into complex, convoluted implementations that hide the program's logic, data structures, and sensitive algorithms. In blockchain contexts, obfuscation is important for several reasons: it protects proprietary trading algorithms and business logic from competitors; it prevents attackers from identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities that might be apparent in readable code; it safeguards cryptographic keys and security mechanisms embedded within contracts; and it makes it harder for malicious actors to create copycat tokens or applications. Various obfuscation techniques include renaming variables to meaningless identifiers, inserting dummy code, control flow flattening, and using advanced encryption methods for sensitive parts of the code. However, obfuscation presents challenges for smart contract auditing and may reduce transparency, a core value in blockchain ecosystems, creating tension between security through obscurity and the open-source ethos of most blockchain platforms.",

One promising direction is indistinguishability obfuscation (iO), a cryptographic technique that transforms a program into a \"black box\" that reveals only its input-output behavior while hiding its implementation details. Zero-knowledge proofs are being integrated with smart contracts to allow verification of computations without revealing the underlying logic or data. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) like Intel SGX provide hardware-based isolation where sensitive computations can be performed securely while publishing only verified results to the blockchain. Functional encryption allows specific functions to be computed on encrypted data without decrypting it. Additionally, researchers are developing formal verification techniques specifically designed for obfuscated code to ensure correctness and security without requiring full transparency. These approaches aim to create a balance between transparency for verification purposes and confidentiality for intellectual property and security, addressing the fundamental tension between these requirements in blockchain smart contracts.",

      "answer": "Bitcoin-NG (Next Generation) improves upon the original Bitcoin protocol by addressing its throughput and latency limitations through a fundamental redesign of blockchain's structure. The key innovation is splitting blocks into two types: key blocks for leader election and microblocks for transaction processing. In Bitcoin-NG, miners compete to create key blocks (similar to traditional Bitcoin mining) which contain no transactions but establish the miner as the leader for the next epoch. Once elected, this leader can continuously create microblocks containing transactions until the next key block is found. This separation dramatically increases transaction throughput since microblocks can be generated at a much higher frequency than Bitcoin's 10-minute blocks. It also reduces transaction latency because confirmation doesn't require waiting for a full mining cycle. Bitcoin-NG maintains Bitcoin's security properties by ensuring that rewards and fees are distributed in ways that discourage selfish mining and incentivize cooperation. While not implemented in Bitcoin itself, Bitcoin-NG's design principles have influenced other blockchain protocols and sidechains seeking to improve scalability while maintaining the security guarantees of proof-of-work consensus.",

Traditional blockchains operate in closed environments, unable to access real-world information (like stock prices or weather data) that many applications require. Town Crier addresses this critical limitation by using trusted hardware, specifically Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), to create a trusted execution environment that guarantees computation integrity. The system works in three layers: the Town Crier contract on the blockchain interfaces with user contracts requesting external data; the SGX-protected Town Crier server retrieves data from websites over HTTPS connections; and a relay that bridges communication between the blockchain and the server. When a smart contract requests data, Town Crier fetches it from specified web sources, generates cryptographic proof that the data was retrieved correctly within the protected environment, and returns this authenticated data to the blockchain. This approach provides strong security guarantees that the data hasn't been tampered with, enabling trustworthy decentralized applications that depend on real-world information while minimizing the need for trusted third parties.",

The system works by establishing a secure execution environment inside SGX enclaves where the payment channel state is maintained and updated with cryptographic guarantees that even the hosting machine cannot tamper with the operations. This architecture provides several key improvements: it achieves near-instant finality for transactions without waiting for blockchain confirmations; it eliminates the need for costly dispute resolution mechanisms on the main chain; it increases privacy since individual transactions within the channel remain confidential; and it allows unilateral channel closure by either party without fear of theft. TEEChan significantly improves Bitcoin's scalability by moving most transactions off-chain while maintaining security guarantees through hardware attestation rather than consensus algorithms. This approach enables higher transaction throughput with lower fees and reduced latency compared to both on-chain transactions and traditional payment channels, making micropayments economically viable on the Bitcoin network.",

Developed by researchers at Cornell University, Falcon addresses one of the fundamental performance bottlenecks in blockchain networks—the time it takes for new blocks to reach all participants in the network. The system employs a combination of innovative techniques: it uses cut-through routing where blocks begin forwarding before they are completely received; it implements compact block relay protocols that transmit only transaction identifiers when possible; and it uses erasure coding to handle packet loss efficiently. Falcon's most distinctive feature is its network topology optimization, which dynamically establishes and maintains connections between nodes based on observed network conditions rather than using a fixed topology. This adaptive approach ensures that blocks take the fastest possible path through the network. By minimizing propagation delays, Falcon reduces the occurrence of orphaned blocks and mitigates the risks of selfish mining attacks. It also enables blockchain networks to safely operate with shorter block intervals and larger block sizes, improving overall throughput without compromising security.

      "answer": "Casper is Ethereum's implementation of Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus that represents a significant shift from the energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism. It consists of two complementary protocols: Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG) and Casper the Friendly GHOST: Correct-by-Construction (CBC). Casper FFG was designed as a hybrid PoW/PoS solution where PoS validators would finalize blocks created through PoW mining, providing economic finality guarantees. Casper CBC focuses on developing a pure PoS protocol with mathematical proofs of correctness. The implementation works by having validators stake ETH as collateral, making them financially liable for honest behavior. Validators take turns proposing and voting on blocks, with voting power proportional to their staked amount. A key innovation in Casper is its slashing conditions—a penalty system that confiscates portions of dishonest validators' stakes. This creates an economic disincentive against attacks and ensures that attempting to manipulate the network costs more than any potential gains. Casper also introduces finality, meaning once blocks receive sufficient attestations, they cannot be reverted without burning a significant amount of staked ETH.

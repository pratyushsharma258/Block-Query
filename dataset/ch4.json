      "question": "What is public key cryptography?",
      "answer": "Public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner. In this system, anyone can encrypt a message using the recipient's public key, but only the recipient can decrypt it using their corresponding private key. This fundamental approach solves the key distribution problem in traditional symmetric encryption and enables secure communication without a pre-shared secret.",

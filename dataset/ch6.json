      "question": "What is the Bitcoin network and how does it maintain decentralization?",
      "answer": "The Bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that operates without a central authority. It maintains decentralization through a distributed network of nodes that all maintain a copy of the blockchain ledger. Each node independently validates transactions and blocks according to consensus rules, preventing any single entity from controlling the network. This decentralization is reinforced by proof-of-work mining, which distributes the power to create new blocks among competing miners worldwide.",

      "answer": "Deterministic and non-deterministic wallets differ in how they generate and manage private keys. Non-deterministic wallets create each new private key randomly, requiring frequent backups as new addresses are generated. Deterministic wallets, however, generate all private keys from a single seed phrase, making backup and recovery much simpler since only the initial seed needs to be secured. This seed-based approach allows users to recover all their addresses and funds using just the seed phrase, even if the original wallet is lost.",

      "question": "How does the Bitcoin network prevent double-spending?",
      "answer": "The Bitcoin network prevents double-spending through a combination of mechanisms. First, all transactions are broadcast to the network and recorded in the blockchain, creating a public ledger of all transfers. When a transaction occurs, nodes verify that the inputs haven't been spent before by checking against this ledger. Mining nodes then bundle verified transactions into blocks, and the proof-of-work consensus mechanism ensures that only one valid chain of blocks is accepted by the network. Once a transaction is confirmed in a block and subsequent blocks are added on top, it becomes exponentially harder to reverse, making double-spending practically impossible after several confirmations.",

      "answer": "Segregated Witness (SegWit) improves Bitcoin transaction efficiency in several ways. First, it separates (segregates) the transaction signatures (witnesses) from the transaction data, reducing the overall block size burden. This separation allows more transactions to fit within each block while maintaining backward compatibility. SegWit also fixes transaction malleability, enabling the development of second-layer solutions like the Lightning Network. Additionally, SegWit transactions typically have lower fees because they use block space more efficiently, and they help prevent certain types of mining optimizations that could centralize mining power.",

      "answer": "Bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21 million coins has significant investment implications. This predetermined scarcity creates deflationary pressure as demand increases against a fixed supply. Unlike traditional currencies subject to inflation through monetary policy, Bitcoin's supply cannot be artificially increased. This characteristic has led many to view Bitcoin as a 'digital gold' or store of value. However, the fixed supply also contributes to price volatility as supply cannot adjust to meet changing demand, making it a high-risk investment requiring careful consideration of market cycles and long-term adoption trends.",

      "answer": "Mining difficulty is a dynamic parameter that adjusts every 2,016 blocks (approximately every two weeks) to maintain a consistent average block time of 10 minutes. It increases or decreases based on the total network hash rate, making the proof-of-work puzzle harder or easier to solve. This automatic adjustment ensures network stability and predictable block creation regardless of changes in mining power. Without this mechanism, blocks could be mined too quickly when hash power increases or too slowly when it decreases, disrupting the network's intended operation.",

      "answer": "A hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet uses a tree-like structure to generate and manage multiple accounts, each with its own addresses, from a single master seed. Following BIP32 specifications, it creates child keys from parent keys using a deterministic algorithm. This hierarchy allows users to create separate accounts for different purposes (e.g., savings, business, trading) while maintaining all private keys under one secure master seed. The hierarchical structure also enables the creation of public keys for receiving payments without exposing the corresponding private keys, making it ideal for businesses that need to generate many addresses while keeping funds secure.",

Miners select transactions from the mempool based primarily on their fee rates, creating an efficient fee market.

      "answer": "Bitcoin payment channels are Layer 2 solutions that allow participants to conduct multiple transactions off-chain while using the main blockchain only for final settlement. They work by creating a multi-signature address where participants lock funds, then exchanging signed transactions that update the balance allocation without broadcasting to the network. This approach solves scaling limitations by reducing the number of on-chain transactions needed for multiple payments between parties.

      "answer": "Bitcoin's Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model treats each transaction output as a discrete unit that must be spent in its entirety, creating new outputs for any change. Unlike account-based systems where balances are tracked directly, UTXOs function like individual bills that must be consumed completely in each transaction. This model enhances privacy since each transaction creates new UTXOs, and it simplifies transaction validation as each UTXO can only be spent once.

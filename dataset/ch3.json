Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a chain where altering any single block would require recalculating all subsequent block hashes. Symmetric encryption contributes to this immutability through consistent, deterministic transformation techniques. The hash functions used in blockchain (like SHA-256 in Bitcoin) share mathematical properties with symmetric encryption modes: they produce fixed-size outputs, demonstrate avalanche effects, and maintain one-way computational characteristics. When a blockchain node validates a block, it performs symmetric encryption-like transformations to verify the block's integrity, ensuring that any tampering becomes computationally detectable.
